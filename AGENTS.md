## Technical Rules
- Always use 'AppError' class for error handling (src/core/error.ts).
- Explicit dto must be defined in model.ts file, make sure its the same between handler and service.

## Name convention
- File name must be in kebab-case.
- Folder name must be in kebab-case.

## Structure File Projects
- `src/core/`: Foundation components (errors, global middlewares, core interfaces) that are agnostic to business logic.
- `src/lib/`: Configurations and wrappers for external libraries/services (Database setup, Redis, Email client, etc.).
- `src/modules/`: Business logic and features grouped by domain (e.g., `auth`). This is where the main API logic lives.
- `src/utils/`: Shared general-purpose utility functions.

# Example to follow
- check module folder structure in src/modules/product/ for example, include how to use middleware, model, pagination, schema, and service.

## How to run project
- Run development server using the bun dev command:

```bash
bun run dev
```
- Build project using the bun run build command to check if there are any errors:

```bash
bun run build
```

- Run production server using the bun run start command:

```bash
bun run start
```

## Development Database with drizzle
If you make any changes in schema, you need to generate migrations and apply them.
- Make sure schema already defined in drizzle/schemas.ts if new schema created in modules folder.

- Generate migrations using the drizzle-kit generate command and then apply them using the drizzle-kit migrate command:

Generate migrations:
```bash
bunx drizzle-kit generate --name "<migration-name>"
```

Check database schema:
```bash
bunx drizzle-kit check
```

Apply migrations:
```bash
bunx drizzle-kit migrate
```

If something the changes not applied to database, you need to reset database.

- Don't ever reset or drop database.
- Don't use `drizzle-kit up`, `drizzle-kit push`, `drizzle-kit drop` command.
